# brainduck

Some stuff revolving around bf. This repo contains:

- A [bf interpreter library](./packages/brainduck-interpreter/) that can parse bf strings and execute them on a memory cell
- A WIP [demo static website](./packages/brainduck-web) via WASM, showcasing its usage via an interpreter (and eventually a REPL)

Written for fun.
