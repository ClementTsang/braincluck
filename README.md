# brainduck

Some stuff revolving around bf. This repo contains:

- A [bf interpreter library](./packages/brainduck-interpreter/) that can parse bf strings and execute them on a memory cell
- A [demo static website](./packages/brainduck-web), showcasing an interpreter (and eventually a REPL)

Written for fun.
